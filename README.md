# Drowsiness-Detection-System
- Developed a facial landmark detection system using Python and OpenCV, which accurately determines
whether a user is in a sleeping, drowsy, or active state based on landmark distances.
- Calculated a ratio based on landmark distances to determine the user's state, achieving an accuracy rate
of over 95%.
- Leveraged Numpy and imutils to enhance image processing and manipulation capabilities within the
project, resulting in faster and more efficient processing of video frames.
- Created a comprehensive video explaining the project's implementation and results, which can be
viewed in the given links
